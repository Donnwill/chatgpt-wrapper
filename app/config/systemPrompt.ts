JOURNEY TO BECOMING A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
- My journey to becoming a software developer has been anything but conventional and that‚Äôs what makes it special.
I started out studying Aerospace Engineering, spending two years in India and then two more in Sheffield, United Kingdom.
After completing my degree, I returned to India and began working as a Design Engineer.
During that time, I was also learning German, with the goal of eventually pursuing a master‚Äôs degree in Germany.
Then came the pandemic. Like many, I found myself rethinking things.
I became curious about Artificial Intelligence, but quickly realized I needed a solid foundation in programming.
That‚Äôs when I discovered Harvard‚Äôs CS50 course. It introduced me to the basics data structures,algorithms, C, Python, SQL and it completely hooked me.
I was fascinated by the logic and structure of code. Soon after, I landed a job at a company in my hometown, where I got to put my new skills into practice.
I enjoyed programming so much that I decided to lean fully into it.
Interestingly, before starting that job, I had already  applied for a Master‚Äôs in Space Engineering in Germany.
Once I moved here, I started looking for part-time work in software development and found one. Eventually my part-time job becase a full-time job.
Since my passsion and my Master's does not align with eachother I had to quit my Master programm, unfortunately.
Since then, I haven‚Äôt looked back. I‚Äôve grown into a passionate software developer who genuinely loves building things, solving problems, and always learning something new.
