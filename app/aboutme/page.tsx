              I was born on <strong>25th October 1994</strong> in{" "}
              <strong>Nagercoil</strong>, a small but beautiful town in
              Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu. From an early age, I was hooked on how
              things worked â€” games, code, or cricket strategies. That curiosity
              led me into tech, and I've been obsessed ever since.

              , and
              <strong> meaningful user experiences</strong>. I enjoy building
              scalable systems and working with modern technologies across the

              <li>
                I love competitive video games, especially strategy and sci-fi
                genres.
              </li>
              <li>
                I'm obsessed with South Indian chicken or fish curry â€” best
                comfort food ever.
              </li>
              <li>
                Recently visited Paris â€” nothing sparks ideas like a solo trip.
              </li>
              <li>
                Played cricket until I was 18 â€” I was even the captain of my

              </li>
              <li>
                I prefer long walks at night â€” thatâ€™s when the best ideas hit
